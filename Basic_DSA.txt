Q1 Linked list and Array
- An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address.

Array works with a static memory. Here static memory means that the memory size is fixed and cannot be changed at the run time.
The Linked list works with dynamic memory. Here, dynamic memory means that the memory size can be changed at the run time according to our requirements.

Array takes more time while performing any operation like insertion, deletion, etc.
Linked list takes less time while performing any operation like insertion, deletion, etc.

Accessing any element in an array is faster as the element in an array can be directly accessed through the index.
Accessing an element in a linked list is slower as it starts traversing from the first element of the linked list.
